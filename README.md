# Obsidian: Combine Daily Notes
A simple Obsidian plugin to automatically combine all daily note files into a single weekly file on Sunday.
This only works if daily notes are in the top level vault directory, and named according to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD.md). This is the default, out of the box configuration for Obsidian, so if you didn't change that you're fine.

To install: clone or unzip this repo into [VAULT_DIR]/.obsidian/plugins/, then run `npm i && npm run build` or `make build`
Reload Obsidian and enable this plugin in the settings.
